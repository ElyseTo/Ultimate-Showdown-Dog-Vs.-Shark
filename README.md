## Game Description
This two-player shooting game is a true test of your skill and button clicking speed. Launch missiles at your opponent while simultaneously dodging the missiles being shot at you. The missiles progressively move faster as you play the game. All sound effects and pixel art is made by us.

## How to play
Player one (Shark) uses 'w' and 's' to move and shoots with button 'd'
Player two (Dog) uses 'i' and 'k' to move and shoots with button 'j'

Each missile that hits you gives your other opponent 2 points, however if you dodge it in time, it will only be worth 1 point.

First to 6 points wins.
